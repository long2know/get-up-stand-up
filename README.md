# Android Get Up Stand Up (For Your Health)

An open source tracker for Wear OS and Android

The purpose of this application is to track when a user has been sitting for too long and needs to get up for a while.  It is intended to go a tiny bit above applications that only track "inactive" state.  Since it's important to stand-up for 15+ minutes per hour, especially rather than sitting at a desk all day, the application will attempt to detect a sitting position and determine if you've met the criteria for standing.
